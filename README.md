# Environmental-AQI-Insights

## Overview

Environmental-AQI-Insights is a Power BI dashboard for analyzing global air quality data (AQI). This project leverages Power BIâ€™s interactive visualizations to provide insights into the global PM2.5 AQI levels and their distribution across various countries. The data is processed using **Azure** services, ensuring robust scalability and data management.

The dashboard offers key insights into:
- AQI Category distributions
- Regional AQI levels
- Analysis of global pollution trends by country

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Global Air Pollution Dataset** that contains pollution data for multiple countries. The data is stored on **Azure Blob Storage**.

## Azure Integration

The data for this project is hosted on **Azure Blob Storage**, and the processing involves leveraging Azure tools to ensure smooth data flow and integration with Power BI.

1. **Azure Storage Account**: The data is stored in an Azure Blob Storage container called **rawdata**. This container is set to allow public access, making it easily accessible for integration with Power BI.
2. **Azure Data Factory**: Azure Data Factory was used to manage and prepare the data for Power BI. It facilitated the process of data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to ensure high-quality, cleaned data.
3. **Power BI**: The dashboard was created using Power BI Desktop, with interactive visualizations to highlight key trends in the AQI data across different countries.

## Key Features

- **AQI Categories**: Includes AQI levels such as Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, Hazardous, and Very Unhealthy.
- **Country-wise Analysis**: A country-based AQI distribution showing pollution levels globally.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: The dashboard is designed to provide an interactive and insightful view of air quality levels across the world.

## Features of the Dashboard

1. **Pollution Categories by Country**: A bar chart that displays the number of countries within each AQI category.
2. **Average AQI by Category**: A donut chart that shows the average AQI value within each category, highlighting how countries are distributed across different pollution levels.
3. **Regional Insights**: A map that provides a geographic breakdown of PM2.5 AQI levels across different regions.
4. **AQI Trends**: A line chart visualizing the AQI values over time across different countries.

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset from the link above or access it directly through Azure.
2. Open **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Import the dataset into Power BI using **Get Data** from Azure.
4. Build the dashboard as per the insights described.
5. Save and publish the report to Power BI service for online access.

## Conclusion

This project provides an insightful and interactive analysis of global air quality data, leveraging both **Power BI** and **Azure** services. By combining these technologies, the dashboard offers a comprehensive view of AQI distribution across the globe, making it easier for individuals, organizations, and governments to understand and act on environmental issues.
