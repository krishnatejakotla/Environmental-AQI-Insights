# Environmental AQI Insights

## Overview
**Environmental AQI Insights** is a Power BI dashboard project that visualizes global air quality data (AQI) with a focus on PM2.5 levels, integrating Azure as the backend for data processing and storage. This project provides valuable insights into the global air quality situation by leveraging Power BI’s interactive visualizations and Azure’s cloud computing services for seamless data management.

The dashboard explores the distribution of AQI categories by country and offers analysis of the environmental impact across various regions. By analyzing AQI data, this project aims to raise awareness about air pollution levels worldwide and offer actionable insights that could benefit policy makers, environmentalists, and citizens alike.

## Key Features
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts and maps that visualize the distribution of PM2.5 AQI data across the globe.
- **AQI Categories**: Includes AQI levels such as `Good`, `Moderate`, `Unhealthy`, `Hazardous`, and `Very Unhealthy`, categorized based on PM2.5 levels.
- **Azure Integration**: The data is processed and stored on Azure, ensuring scalability, security, and seamless access for Power BI.
- **Data Filtering**: The report includes slicers to filter data by country, AQI category, and other relevant parameters.
- **Regional Insights**: Provides regional comparisons for AQI levels, showing which areas have the most hazardous pollution.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Used to create the interactive dashboards and visualizations. Power BI integrates with the Azure backend for live data processing and visualization.
- **Azure**: Used to store and process AQI data. This Azure backend is designed to manage large datasets and provide seamless integration with Power BI.
- **PM2.5 AQI Dataset**: A comprehensive dataset containing PM2.5 AQI readings from various global monitoring systems.

## Problem Solved
Global air quality is a significant concern, and this project offers a solution to:
- **Track Air Quality**: By visualizing AQI levels across countries, the dashboard helps users understand pollution trends and their environmental impacts.
- **Actionable Insights**: The ability to filter data by AQI categories and countries provides detailed insights into pollution levels, helping decision-makers make informed choices.
- **Cloud Integration**: Using Azure for backend data processing allows for secure and scalable management of large datasets, ensuring real-time updates and access to stakeholders.

## What Was Done in Azure
1. **Data Storage**: The AQI dataset is stored in **Azure SQL Database**. Azure ensures that the data is secure, easily accessible, and scalable as the dataset grows.
2. **Data Integration**: Azure was used for preprocessing the data to make it ready for analysis in Power BI. This included tasks such as data cleaning, categorization, and aggregation.
3. **Real-Time Data Access**: Azure ensures seamless access to updated AQI data for Power BI, enabling the dashboard to show the most up-to-date information.
4. **Scalable Cloud Solution**: With Azure, the solution is designed to scale efficiently to handle larger datasets and more complex queries as the project expands.

## Insights and Solution
- **Pollution Hotspots**: By analyzing AQI data by country, this dashboard identifies regions with the highest levels of pollution, allowing organizations and governments to target interventions more effectively.
- **Regional Comparison**: Users can compare AQI levels across different regions, helping to identify areas where pollution control efforts are working and where improvements are needed.
- **Public Awareness**: By presenting the data in an interactive format, the dashboard makes it easier for the public to understand the impact of pollution on their health and environment, fostering a proactive approach to air quality improvement.

## How to Run the Report
1. **Open the Power BI Report**: Open the `Environmental AQI Insights.pbix` file using Power BI Desktop.
2. **Ensure Azure Integration**: Make sure that the Azure backend is connected to Power BI for real-time data access.
3. **Explore the Data**: Use slicers and interactive charts to filter and explore the AQI data by country, AQI category, and other parameters.
